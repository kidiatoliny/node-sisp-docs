The port keeps the architecture of `laravel-sisp` 2.x: actions, builders, pipelines, drivers, and contracts. Laravel's container is replaced by explicit constructor wiring in `createSisp`. The layout is hexagonal: core contracts and domain sit at the centre; application orchestrates them; infrastructure provides the adapters; presentation exposes the HTTP surface.

## Key decisions

- **Pipelines** are arrays of `{ handle(context, next) }` objects executed by a tiny async runner. The default pipe sets can be customized per flow through `pipelines.payment` and `pipelines.callback`.
- **Models** are the knex adapter's repository implementations behind the `SispStorage` port. `Transaction.update` diffs changes, encrypts the payload, and appends the audit log in one place.
- **Payment intents** live at the HTTP boundary. They reserve checkout keys, link keys to transactions, and allow safe replay of the same checkout.
- **Transaction attempts** live under the parent transaction. They preserve every gateway submission and let callbacks update the exact attempt that SISP answered.
- **Drivers** decide the payment endpoint and the status API client. `manager.extend('custom', factory)` registers new gateways.
- **Credential scoping** rebuilds only the credential-dependent services (`wiring.ts`) around a static resolver, which is how `forCredentials` works without a container.
- **Parity** with the PHP package is pinned by golden vectors generated from the real implementation, not by re-derived constants.

## Storage adapters

The persistence layer sits behind an ORM-neutral port, `SispStorage`, defined in `src/core/contracts/storage.ts`: nine entity repositories plus a `transaction()` unit-of-work, an optional `migrate?()`, and `destroy()`. The port leaks no engine types.

Two adapters ship with the package:

- `KnexStorage` (`src/infrastructure/storage/knex/`) - the default, built from the `database` config. Handles migrations automatically and exposes `sisp.db` for raw queries.
- `PrismaStorage` (`src/infrastructure/storage/prisma/`) - available at the `@akira-io/sisp/prisma` subpath. Injected via `createSisp({ storage: createPrismaStorage(prisma, tables, appKey, { provider }) })`. The core bundle never imports `@prisma/client`.

Both adapters are validated by the shared contract suite `tests/storage/contract.ts`, which guarantees behavioral parity. See [Storage Adapters](/12-storage-adapters/) for the Prisma quick start and instructions for implementing custom adapters.

The application layer runs every database transaction through `storage.transaction(tx => ...)` with locked reads via the repository `...ForUpdate` methods, so atomicity and locking are adapter-decided.

Intentionally knex-coupled surfaces kept for this phase: the `database.connection` config type, the `sisp.db` escape hatch, the CLI `migrate` command, and the `runMigrations`/`createKnexInstance` re-exports. Engine selection and genericizing the `database` config are a later phase.

## Differences from the Laravel package

- Rendering is out of scope: the core returns render-ready data and HTML auto-submit forms only.
- PDF invoice generation is deferred; the invoice rows and statuses are maintained.
- Geolocation providers are not bundled; metadata captures device data only.
- Scheduling is the host's job: call `reconcilePending()` from your scheduler or cron the CLI.
