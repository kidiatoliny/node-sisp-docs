Patterns validated against the live gateway. See [examples](examples/00-index.md).

Grouped by HTTP adapter; each adapter carries its storage variants (knex, Prisma) plus frontend and behavior patterns.

| Adapter | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Fastify | [Fastify examples](examples/fastify/00-index.md) |

Express and NestJS follow the same per-adapter layout as they are added.
